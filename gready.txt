#### Step 1: Initial Setup
- **Covered Columns**: None initially.
- **Selected Rows**: Empty initially.

#### Step 2: First Iteration
- **Find the Most Effective Row**: The algorithm checks each row to see how many new columns it can cover. In this case, rows 1, 4, and 9 are the most effective, each covering 3 new columns.
- **Select a Row**: Let's say the algorithm selects row 1 (third row from the top, with indices starting at 0) as it covers columns 4, 5, and 6.
- **Update**: Covered columns are now 4, 5, and 6. The selected rows list now includes row 1.

#### Step 3: Second Iteration
- **Find the Most Effective Row**: Now, the algorithm ignores columns 4, 5, and 6 since they are already covered. Rows 1, 4, and 9 are still the most effective, each covering 3 new columns.
- **Select a Row**: This time, let's say the algorithm selects row 4 (fifth row from the top).
- **Update**: Covered columns are now 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The selected rows list includes rows 1 and 4.

#### Step 4: Third Iteration
- **Find the Most Effective Row**: Checking the remaining uncovered columns (8, 9, 10), row 9 (tenth row from the top) is the most effective as it covers 3 new columns.
- **Select a Row**: The algorithm selects row 9.
- **Update**: All columns are now covered. The selected rows list includes rows 1, 4, and 9.

#### Step 5: Result
- The Greedy algorithm concludes that rows 1, 4, and 9 together provide the minimum row coverage for the matrix.
- **Selected Rows**: [1, 4, 9]

### Key Observations

- The Greedy algorithm selects rows based on their immediate effectiveness in covering the maximum number of uncovered columns.
- It doesn't always guarantee the optimal solution (the absolute minimum number of rows) but provides a solution that's generally close to optimal and found quickly.
- In this specific case, the Greedy algorithm has efficiently found a set of rows that covers all columns, demonstrating its practicality for this type of problem.
